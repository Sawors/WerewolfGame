# Some entries use placeholders, when translating please DO NOT modify these (you can move them,
# but in most case do not remove placeholders from the entry).
# A placeholder looks like this : %data%


# PLURAL CANNOT BE USED YET, PLEASE IGNORE THE FOLLOWING COMMENT BLOCK!
        # To make plurals you can use the additive plural format (friend -> friends) by appending %-p% at the end of your
        # word, to define this plural form use additive-plural-mark.
        # If your language uses more than just the additive plural form (most languages) you can use up to 8 plural replacements
        # defined in plural-replaces. This list is dynamically loaded, so you can define as many replacements as you want
        # to define a replacement use this method :
        #   singular: plural
        # Example :
        #   y: "ie"
        # to use them simply use the placeholder %y% and replace the "y" with the singular form of your replacement
        # Examples :
        #   friend%-p%
        #     singular : friend
        #     plural : friends
        #   quer%y%
        #     singular : query
        #     plural : queries
        # PLURAL CANNOT BE USED YET !

invites:
  #
  #   CUSTOM INVITES
  #
  # Discord formatting is allowed (styles can be combined) :
  #   *text* : italic
  #   **text** : bold
  #   ***text*** : bold italic
  #   __text__ : underline
  #   ~~text~~ : strikethrough
  #   > text : indent (quote)
  #   >>> text : multiline indent (quote)
  #   ||text|| : spoiler
  #   `text` : code block (single line)
  #   ```text``` : code block (multiple lines)
  #
  # DO NOT remove the little "|-" at the beginning, it allows you to write your invite with multiple lines.
  # Allowed PLACEHOLDERS in invite body :
  #   %HH% : hour when the invite has been sent with two digits in 24h format (01, 23, 13, 03, 00)
  #   %mm% : minutes, format like hour
  #   %ss% : seconds, format like hour
  #   %YYYY% : year, with 4 digits (2004, 2022, 2132, 1142)
  #   %MM% : month, with 2 digits (12, 01, 04)
  #   %dd% : day of month, with 2 digits (31, 01, 28)
  #   %id% : the game unique ID, useless for most players
  #   %message% : UNUSED at the moment, might be used in the future to allow users to append custom messages to their invites
  #   %type% : indicates if the game is public or private (mind that the "type" is in english whatever the language, so I advise you to put it in Discord's code-block style : `%type%` to avoid creating an awkward looking text)
  #   %button% : the text on the "Join Game" button defined by buttons.join-game or buttons.join-private-game if the game is private
  invite-body-customizable: |-
