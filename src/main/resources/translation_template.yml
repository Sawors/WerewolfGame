# This file can be used as a translation template, original text (en_DEFAULT)
# is added on top of each entry for you to know easily what to translate.
#
# Some entries use placeholders, when translating please DO NOT modify these (you can move them,
# but in most case do not remove placeholders from the entry).
# A placeholder looks like this : %data%


# PLURAL CANNOT BE USED YET !

# To make plurals you can use the additive plural format (friend -> friends) by appending %-p% at the end of your
# word, to define this plural form use additive-plural-mark.
# If your language uses more than just the additive plural form (most languages) you can use up to 8 plural replacements
# defined in plural-replaces. This list is dynamically loaded, so you can define as many replacements as you want
# to define a replacement use this method :
#   singular: plural
# Example :
#   y: "ie"
# to use them simply use the placeholder %y% and replace the "y" with the singular form of your replacement
# Examples :
#   friend%-p%
#     singular : friend
#     plural : friends
#   quer%y%
#     singular : query
#     plural : queries
